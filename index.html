<p>The annual African Restaurant week festival is taking place October 8th weekend in Flatbush, Brooklyn marking the 8th year of the African fashion, music, food and cultural festival. As a Ugandan born New Yorker I was excited to go on their website to find food from my home being featured, but since I have yet to find any Ugandan restaurants in New York City I shouldnt have been surprised at the lack of options. With Sub Saharan Africans making up only <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/sub-saharan-african-immigrants-united-states-2018">4.5%</a> of immigrant population and New York and with New York not being a notable diasporic location for Ugandans and East Africans in general, the lack of representation in New York's "African" cuisine is expected.
</p>
<p1>So which countries are represented?</p1>
<p> As of 2019, only 21,718 of New York's 468,820 foriegn born population are African, that is only 4.6% according to <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/">social explorer's (2019) estimates</a> . Ethiopians are the most represented East African country in New York and still only make up 0.3% of New York City's foreign born population. But let me stop harping on my little piece of Africa, any African cultural representation in New York is wonderful to see.
</p>
<p>Here are the top five home countries of foreign born Africans and how they will be represented at this years festival (country demographic data is from <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/">social explorer (2019) estimates</a>):
